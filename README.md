# Tetrad Controller

**As of 2017-07-05 I am putting this on hold, I hope to have more time for it soon.**

What hopes to be a cheap solution for closed and open loop DC motor control. Currently the electronics have been verified as working (except CAN, that is not tested yet). There is some very sloppy and hacky code written so I could use it in my Applied Robotics class, so it technically 'works', but I am far from happy.
