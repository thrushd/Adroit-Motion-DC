What hopes to be a cheap solution for closed and open loop DC motor control. 

More info on my [personal website](http://www.dylanthrush.com/2017/04/13/adroit-motion-dc-motor-controller-v0-1/ "Click me :3").

[Email list](https://goo.gl/forms/3taDReKKCc0vywla2 "Click this too") for updates (I promise not to bug you). 

To Do:
- Position control (Needs fine tuning)
  - How to control max speeds
- PID autotuning  
- Serial communication interface for testing
  - Serial protocol for realzies
- Homing
- CAN interface
- Figure out movement protocols (gcode parsing?)
- Other stuff I am forgetting
